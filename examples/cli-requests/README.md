# CLI Requests Example

## Environment Setup

1. Fill out `.env.example` with your client id and client secret.
2. Rename to `.env`.
3. Because this is an example we don't need to worry about the Refresh Token
but if your token is expired, make sure you refresh it from the Client's page
before you start the example.
